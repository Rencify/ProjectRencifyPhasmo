# ProjectRencifyPhasmo
This is the external trainer written in C#, that is made for the game 'Phasmophobia' - which is currently working on 0.26.8.1
I didn't bother cleaning up the code or organising it better as I didn't think I was going to release the source to the public, but oh well there is it if you want to see how I made it. Hopefully it can help someone!

# Features
- Player Stats Modifier (Rank/Money/Basketball/Items)
- FOV Changer+
- Walk & Run Speed Modifiers
- Grab Distance Modifier
- 100% Sanity
- Fullbright Mode
- Teleportation Options
- Vision Options + Game Hue Changer
- Troll Options (Name Changer/360 Camera) - Ghost Hunt is there, but it's client sided. You can use it as an ESP.
- Friendly/simple UI using MetroFramework & Bunifu

# How to use?
Open the .sln (solution) file in Visual Studio 2019. You may need to reference the MetroFramework & Bunifu DLL files if it doesn't pick it up already. Feel free to mess around with it and do whatever, but please don't take full credit if you leave it as it as and just change the name of the tool lol...

# Credits
Thanks to Coderbox1/Glatrix & Zephirot for their Cheat Tables, which gave me a few cool ideas for the trainer.
